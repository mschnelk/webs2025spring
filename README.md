## Updates
### March 18, 2025

For my original design, I wanted to create a travel blog/photo album to showcase my experiences abroad. However, I was not in love with this idea at all, so I ended up thinking through new ideas of what to do. I eventually decided that, for my website, I wanted to create a portfolio/booking website for my tattoo artist. I really love her and her artwork, so I wanted to create something that encapsulated the style of tattoos and vibe that she has in her studio.

I really like the way <a href = "https://learn.kevinpowell.co/course/html-css-for-absolute-beginners">Kevin Powell's HTML and CSS for absolute beginners course</a> used a design-first implementation. I think it's much easier for me to force myself to try new things and experiment with layouts when I have a unique or complex design already picked out. As such, I started working on my design in Canva and created one for the homepage, flash page, and footer of my website. I may have gotten a little carried away, and I'm not entirely sure how this will be implemented, but I'm really happy with what I was left with. I think I will work more on the flash page design before implementation, so my next steps will instead get started on the homepage and footer HTML/CSS.

Before I began working on the HTML, I decided to block out the design I already created. I'm a very visual person, so it's easier for me to work when I can see exactly what I'm trying to do. I ended up with these two blocked designs for the homepage and the footer.

After I created this basic blocked-out design, I started working on the HTML and the images for my program. I ended up making the side panels on Photoshop, using cutouts from different instagram posts. I think they turned out pretty good and they look almost exactly like the design I originally implemented. I forgot to take a screenshot of my left panel psd file (and stupidly deleted it after exporting), but you can see what I made below. I also used Photoshop to remove the background on the embellishments around the text "Jackie O," and I expect to use it for a lot of other pieces in the footer.

With that all completed, I started on my HTML. I originally planned on doing the HTML for both the homepage and the footer before adding any CSS. However, I soon realized that would not work well, since the site makes absolutely no sense without the CSS, and it would drive me crazy to continue to look at it like that while implementing the footer. So, instead, I've decided to add the HTML and CSS for the homepage before working on the footer. 

So far, I have added all the elements for the homepage, without any styling. I think the use of my divs and classes will make the formatting and CSS relatively straight forward, so I'm happy with how I left it. AS you can see in the screenshots below, the images from photoshop ended up being really big, so that's the main reason why I feel the need to add CSS before continuing with my footer. However, even with the images in the way, I could see that my elements were being saved and added correctly, so I feel prepared to continue with the CSS when I come back.

### March 19, 2025 (in class)
During time in studio today, I had a chance to work on the CSS for my homepage. The CSS itself was suprisingly pretty minimal effort. The navigation was very similar to the one in Kevin Powell's tutorial, so I didn't have any issues with that, or will the grid layout (which was also almost exactly the same to the tutorial). The only thing that differed, was the imported fonts, which I was able to look up easily, so hopefully that's working correctly. I ended up with this, which I think looks great and a lot like my original design.

### March 24, 2025
Since last class, I started working on the flash page. I added in all the images and few buttons that don't work yet. I had some issues with formatting at first, since I didn't want the images to be perfectly aligned in rows.

However, I was able to mess around with grid layouts and ended up with the layout I had initially wished for.

I still am not sure about how I will go about doing the borders. At first, I thought I'd just go through the colors for every nth child. However, with the new formatting it ended up applying a color to images in each row instead of each individual image. I don't hate how it looks, but it's not what I intended. Later, I will either choose one color to add to all the images, or figure out a different way to "randomize" the colors. 
Also, I want to add some script to make the buttons work how they should, and figure out how I will be going about alt text for these images. 

### March 30, 2025
I haven't changed much since the last update. I added the other pages along with the standard header and footers to each page. The portfolio doesn't have any images yet, but I can use the same css from the flash page to set it up, I will just need to add the images into the folder. I experimented a bit with the js to try and auto fill the gallery with the images in the folder, but I was unsuccessful since I haven't used js before. I think that will be something I do for the final project, and for next time I will just focus on building the other two pages.
I also tried to add the stars from the design I originally created for the flash/portfolio pages. I haven't figured out how to have them placed in the background in specific spots, so now they're just awkwardly pasted onto the page. This is also something I'm going to work on later.
