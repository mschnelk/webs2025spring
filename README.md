For my original design, I wanted to create a travel blog/photo album to showcase my experiences abroad. However, I was not in love with this idea at all, so I ended up thinking through new ideas of what to do. I eventually decided that, for my website, I wanted to create a portfolio/booking website for my tattoo artist. I really love her and her artwork, so I wanted to create something that encapsulated the style of tattoos and vibe that she has in her studio.

I really like the way <a href = "https://learn.kevinpowell.co/course/html-css-for-absolute-beginners">Kevin Powell's HTML and CSS for absolute beginners course</a> used a design-first implementation. I think it's much easier for me to force myself to try new things and experiment with layouts when I have a unique or complex design already picked out. As such, I started working on my design in Canva and created one for the homepage, flash page, and footer of my website. I may have gotten a little carried away, and I'm not entirely sure how this will be implemented, but I'm really happy with what I was left with. I think I will work more on the flash page design before implementation, so my next steps will instead get started on the homepage and footer HTML/CSS.
