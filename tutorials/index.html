                            <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
                            <p>Unlike <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
